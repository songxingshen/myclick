 * FASTPSPSOURCE(RATE, LIMIT, LENGTH, SRCETH, SRCIP, SPORT, DSTETH, DSTIP, DPORT [, CHECKSUM, INTERVAL, ACTIVE])
 * =s udp
 * creates packets with static UDP/IP/Ethernet headers
 * =d
 * FastPSPSource is a benchmark tool. At initialization
 * time, FastPSPSource creates a UDP/IP packet of length
 * LENGTH (min 60), with source ethernet address SRCETH,
 * source IP address SRCIP, source port SPORT,
 * destination ethernet address DSTETH, destination IP
 * address DSTIP, and destination port DPORT. The UDP
 * checksum is calculated if CHECKSUM is true; it is
 * true by default. Each time the FastPSPSource element
 * is called, it increments the reference count on the
 * skbuff created and returns the skbuff object w/o
 * copying or cloning. Therefore, the packet returned by
 * FastPSPSource should not be modified.
 *
 * FastPSPSource sents packets at RATE packets per
 * second. It will send LIMIT number of packets in
 * total.
 *
 * After FastPSPSource has sent LIMIT packets, it will
 * calculate the average send rate (packets per second)
 * between the first and last packets sent and make that
 * available in the rate handler.
 *
 * By default FastPSPSource is ACTIVE.
 *
 * INTERVAL is zero by default. If it is not 0, after
 * INTERVAL number of packets, both sport and dport will
 * be incremented by 1. Checksum will be recomputed.
 *
 * =h count read-only
 * Returns the total number of packets that have been generated.
 * =h rate read/write
 * Returns or sets the RATE parameter.
 * =h reset write
 * Reset and restart.
 * =h active write
 * Change ACTIVE
 *
